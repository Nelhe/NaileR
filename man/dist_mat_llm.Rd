\title{LLM distance matrix}
\usage{
dist_mat_llm(ppt, n, per_miss = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{ppt}{an LLM prompt.}

\item{n}{the number of responses to be generated.}

\item{per_miss}{the proportion of missing values in the final matrix (between 0 and 1; 0 by default).}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item a list of the LLM results for each iteration;
\item a distance matrix.
}
}
\description{
Compute a distance matrix between randomly-generated responses to an LLM prompt.
}
\details{
The final percentage of missing values might differ from the per_miss parameter value; rather than a percentage of values being turned to NA, each value has a per_miss probability of being NA.
