\usage{
nail_catdes(
  dataset,
  num.var,
  introduction = NULL,
  request = NULL,
  model = "llama3",
  isolate.groups = FALSE,
  drop.negative = FALSE,
  proba = 0.05,
  row.w = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{a data frame made up of at least one categorical variable and a set of quantitative variables and/or categorical variables.}

\item{num.var}{the index of the variable to be characterized.}

\item{introduction}{the introduction for the LLM prompt.}

\item{request}{the request made to the LLM.}

\item{model}{the model name ('llama3' by default).}

\item{isolate.groups}{a boolean that indicates whether to give the LLM a single prompt, or one prompt per category. Recommended with long catdes results.}

\item{drop.negative}{a boolean that indicates whether to drop negative v.test values for interpretation (keeping only positive v.tests). Recommended with long catdes results.}

\item{proba}{the significance threshold considered to characterize the categories (by default 0.05).}

\item{row.w}{a vector of integers corresponding to an optional row weights (by default, a vector of 1 for uniform row weights)}

\item{generate}{a boolean that indicates whether to generate the LLM response. If FALSE, the function only returns the prompt.}
}
\value{
A data frame, or a list of data frames, containing the LLM's prompt and response (if generate = TRUE).
}
\description{
Generate an LLM response to analyze a categorical latent variable.
}
\details{
This function directly sends a prompt to an LLM. Therefore, to get a consistent answer, we highly recommend to customize the parameters introduction and request and add all relevant information on your data for the LLM. We also recommend renaming the columns with clear, unshortened and unambiguous names.

Additionally, if isolate.groups = TRUE, you will need an introduction and a request that take into account the fact that only one group is analyzed at a time.

# Processing time is often longer than ten seconds

### Example 1: Fisher's iris ###
library(NaileR)

from 3 different species: setosa, versicolor and virginica.
I will give you the results from this study.
You will have to identify what sets these flowers apart."

Also, tell me which species has the biggest flowers,
and which species has the smallest."

This study had 2 parts. In the first part,
participants had to rate how acceptable

In the second part, they had to say
