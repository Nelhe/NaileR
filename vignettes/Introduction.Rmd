NaileR in an R package that uses convenience functions offered by the FactoMineR package (condes, catdes, descfreq) in conjunction with the ollamar package.

Its two main goals are to:

* generate latent variables descriptions with the help of AI;
* offer similarity measure tools for textual data.

In this document, we will focus on the main functions NaileR offers to help interpret latent variables.
